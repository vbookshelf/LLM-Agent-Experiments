## Exp_7 - Create improved Gemini API working chat app with frontend

### Objectives
- Create a working web chat app that uses the Gemini API.

### Notes
- The app still displays a raw json string (```json ```) sometimes. Trying to fix this by converting strings to json causes crashes.
- This can be fixed by replacing curly braces etc. with blank spaces just before displaying the content on the page.
